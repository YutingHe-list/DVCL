Dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL), with its powerful dense posterior distribution learning ability, has greatly improved the learning efficiency for image dense prediction tasks, showing its great potential to reduce the large costs of medical image collection and dense annotation. However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&N) feature pairs in DCRL. In this project, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) Learning  which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery to learn an effective dense contrast under the condition of medical images' inherent topology.
